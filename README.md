GoRTT is seeking to implement an online recruitment system which will aid citizens to conveniently access job vacancies within MDAs, making applying for these positions simple, quick and trackable while lessening the cost of marketing these positions to the general public. This solution will improve citizen satisfaction and quicken the rate at which MDAs can complete the hiring process. EmployTT is expected to be developed in multiple phases with Phase 1 being implemented via this Hackathon.
